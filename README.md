**Both commands work from anywhere on your system!**

### Option 3: Manual Build

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/Goenvim/FlexingUSB.git
cd FlexingUSB

# Build release version
swift build -c release

# Manually copy to PATH
sudo cp .build/release/FlexingUSB /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp scripts/flexingusb /usr/local/bin/flexingusb
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flexingusb
```

**Now you can use both commands from anywhere:**
- `FlexingUSB` - Full command
- `flexingusb` - Short command (launcher script)

### Option 4: Homebrew (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Future installation method
brew install flexingusb
```

### Option 5: Global Launcher Script

After installation, you can also use the shorter `flexingusb` command from anywhere:

```bash
# Use the shorter command
flexingusb start
flexingusb list
flexingusb quick flash --iso /path/to/file.iso
```

The launcher script automatically finds and runs the FlexingUSB binary, making it easier to use from any directory.

   - Simple y/n confirmation before destructive operations
   - Shows detailed information about what will be erased

3. **Dry Run Mode**:
   - Test operations without actually writing data
   - See exactly what commands would be executed

4. **Verification**:
   - Optional SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksum verification
   - Byte-for-byte comparison ensures written data matches source ISO
   - Real-time hashing with progress indicators

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful error messages
   - Safe cleanup on failures

---

## Technical Details

### Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Swift**: 5.9+
- **Xcode**: 15.0+ (for development)
- **Privileges**: sudo access for disk operations

### Technologies Used

- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependency management and building
- **ArgumentParser**: Command-line argument parsing from Apple
- **CryptoKit**: SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksum calculation
- **Foundation**: Low-level file I/O, process execution, and POSIX APIs
- **Darwin**: Direct system calls for O_SYNC, fsync, and raw device access

### Write Methods

FlexingUSB uses a high-performance direct I/O writer:

1. **Direct I/O** (default in v1.1.0+): Fast, native Swift implementation
   - 16MB buffer size for maximum throughput
   - Direct file-to-device writes (no external commands)
   - Real-time progress with speed and ETA
   - 30-50 MB/s average speed (3-5x faster than dd)
   - Inspired by Rufus's approach

2. **Legacy dd/asr** (fallback): Available in Writer.swift for compatibility
   - Uses external `dd` command with raw disk device
   - Slower but universally compatible

### Performance Comparison

| Version | Method | Block Size | Speed | 2.8GB ISO Time |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|----------------|
| v1.0.0 | `dd` | 8MB | ~10-15 MB/s | 3-5 minutes |
| **v1.1.0** | **Direct I/O** | **16MB** | **30-50 MB/s** | **1-2 minutes** |

**Note**: Actual speeds depend on:
- **USB Port**: USB 3.0/3.1 (5-10 Gbps) vs USB 2.0 (480 Mbps)
- **Drive Quality**: High-quality drives achieve 40-50 MB/s, budget drives 20-30 MB/s
- **ISO Size**: Larger ISOs benefit more from the optimized buffer size
- **System Load**: Background processes may impact performance

## Troubleshooting

### "No external disks found"

**Problem**: FlexingUSB doesn't see your USB drive.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure USB drive is properly connected
- Try a different USB port
- Check Disk Utility to see if macOS recognizes the drive
- Try unplugging and replugging the drive

### "Permission denied" errors

**Problem**: Insufficient privileges for disk operations.

**Solutions**:
- FlexingUSB requires admin privileges for disk operations
- You'll be prompted for your password when needed
- Ensure your user account has admin privileges
- Run commands normally (don't prefix with sudo)

### Write is very slow

**Problem**: Writing takes longer than expected.

**Solutions**:
- With v1.1.0+, writes should be 30-50 MB/s (check version with `FlexingUSB --version`)
- Typical times: 2.8GB ISO in 1-2 minutes, 4-5GB ISO in 2-3 minutes
- Ensure you're using USB 3.0 ports for faster speeds
- Avoid USB hubs when possible
- Slow USB 2.0 drives may only achieve 10-15 MB/s (hardware limitation)

### Verification failed

**Problem**: USB checksum doesn't match ISO.

**Solutions**:
- The write may have failed - try writing again
- Check USB drive for hardware issues
- Try a different USB drive
- Verify ISO file isn't corrupted (check download)

### "Internal disk not allowed" error

**Problem**: Trying to use /dev/disk0.

**Solution**: This is intentional! FlexingUSB blocks operations on internal disks for safety. Use an external USB drive only.
