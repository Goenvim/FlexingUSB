##  Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### Documentation

```swift
/// Brief description of what the function does
///
/// More detailed explanation if needed, including:
/// - Important behavior
/// - Edge cases
/// - Usage examples
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - param1: Description of parameter
///   - param2: Description of parameter
/// - Returns: Description of return value
/// - Throws: Description of errors that can be thrown
func exampleFunction(param1: String, param2: Int) throws -> Bool {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

- Always use proper error handling with `throws` or `Result`
- Create descriptive error types
- Provide helpful error messages to users

```swift
enum MyError: Error, LocalizedError {
    case specificProblem(String)
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .specificProblem(let details):
            return "Problem occurred: \(details)"
        }
    }
}
```

### Safety

- **Critical**: Never allow operations on internal disks
- Always validate user input
- Provide clear confirmations before destructive operations
- Include dry-run modes for testing

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, test:

- [ ] `FlexingUSB list` - Lists external drives correctly
- [ ] `FlexingUSB start --dry-run` - Simulates without writing
- [ ] `FlexingUSB start` - Full write workflow
- [ ] `FlexingUSB restore` - USB restoration
- [ ] `FlexingUSB verify` - Verification process
- [ ] Error handling - Try invalid inputs
- [ ] Safety checks - Ensure disk0 is blocked

### Unit Tests (Future)

We're working on adding comprehensive unit tests. Areas that need testing:

- Disk parsing from `diskutil` output
- Safety validation logic
- ISO type detection
- Checksum calculation
- Error handling scenarios

##  UI/UX Guidelines

### Terminal Output

- Use colors meaningfully:
  - **Red**: Errors and critical warnings
  - **Yellow**: Warnings and cautions
  - **Green**: Success messages
  - **Cyan**: Headers and informational
  - **White**: Standard output

- Include emojis for better UX:
  - [OK] Success
  - [ERROR] Error
  - [WARNING] Warning
  -  Safety/Security

- Always show progress for long operations
- Provide clear, actionable error messages

### User Interactions

- Make prompts clear and unambiguous
- Provide sensible defaults
- Show what will happen before doing it
- Allow cancellation at any step

##  Code Review Process

### What We Look For

- **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
- **Safety**: Does it maintain safety guarantees?
- **Code quality**: Is it readable and maintainable?
- **Documentation**: Are changes documented?
- **Testing**: Has it been tested thoroughly?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious performance issues?

### Review Timeline

- We aim to review PRs within 7 days
- Complex changes may take longer
- Please be patient and responsive to feedback

##  Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Homebrew formula for easy installation
